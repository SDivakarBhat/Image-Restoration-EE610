Assignment 2 EE 610 IITB
Blurring of images is a predominant problem
faced in hand-held photography. Several techniques exist for
restoring the sharp image from the blurred picture. This
assignment revolves mainly around the problem of Image
Restoration when the blur kernel is known. Some of the
approaches used in this include full inverse, truncated inverse,
Wiener filter, etc. The quality of deblurring is also measured
using metrics like PSNR and SSIM. Finally restoration of a
new image is done by estimating the blur kernel from scratch.
